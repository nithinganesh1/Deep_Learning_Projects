# FaceDetection

This project builds a face detection system that uses the power of deep learning!

 It combines two models:

* A custom-made deep learning model you trained specifically to find faces.

* The famous VGG16 model, is known for its image recognition skills.

### Try this model
* Clone the Repository
* Open FaceDetection.ipynb
* run from load model and run cell or import library that needed
